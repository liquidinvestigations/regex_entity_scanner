"""Turn the Open Location Code test data into conformance cases for the two coordinate rules.

``vendored/reference/open-location-code/test_data/`` is the specification's own conformance
material, and three of its four files answer three different questions:

* ``validityTests.csv`` is a code with the validity upstream asserts for it, and its invalid half is
  the adversarial set nobody could write for themselves — a plus sign in the wrong place, padding
  after data, a non-alphabet Unicode character in the middle, a bare separator.
* ``decoding.csv`` is a code with the cell its decode produces, as ``latLo,lngLo,latHi,lngHi``. The
  point a code names is the centre of that cell, which is what the rule reports, so the expected
  value is computed from the four corners rather than asserted here.
* ``encoding.csv`` and ``shortCodeTests.csv`` carry the latitude and longitude a code encodes as
  two adjacent comma-separated cells, which is the decimal rule's surface form exactly: the byte run
  ``20.3700625,2.7821875`` is in the file, so the token is upstream's and not something joined out
  of two columns.

Two implementations of the same code reach a coordinate by different arithmetic and disagree in the
last bits of the double. The runner compares a geographic point componentwise within a billionth of
a degree for that reason, so these cases carry the value upstream computed rather than a rounded
one.

The script emits one JSON object per line on stdout, sorted by id, in the shape the Rust runner
reads. It runs inside the dev container and needs no network; the case file it writes is checked in.
