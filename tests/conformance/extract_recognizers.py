"""Turn the Recognizers-Text English specs into normalised conformance cases.

``vendored/reference/recognizers-text/Specs/`` holds, per recogniser, a JSON list of free-text
inputs with the extractions Microsoft's recognisers are expected to produce and the values those
extractions resolve to. Unlike a doctest corpus it is *already* free text, so the carrier sentence
the other extractors build is not used here: upstream's own sentence is what we scan, and the
offsets come from upstream's own ``Start``/``End``/``Length`` where it gives them.

An input with an empty ``Results`` list is upstream saying "there is nothing of this kind in this
sentence", which is the invalid half of the corpus. The whole input is recorded as the token for
those, because upstream names no span to point at, and the scorer's overlap test then asks the
right question: did anything at all fire in a sentence upstream says is empty.

The exclusions are large and they are the finding, not a way around it. Upstream's date recognisers
resolve natural language and relative expressions; our four date rules ship the machine-readable
formats that fix a whole day, and nothing else. Upstream's phone recogniser matches national form;
``phone.international`` matches international form only, and its card says why. Both limits are
written in the tracked tree, which is the test an exclusion has to pass.

The script emits one JSON object per line on stdout, in the shape the Rust runner reads. It runs
inside the dev container and needs no network; the case file it writes is checked in.
