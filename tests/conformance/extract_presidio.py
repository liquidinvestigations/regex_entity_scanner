"""Turn Presidio's recogniser tests into normalised conformance cases.

``vendored/reference/presidio/tests/`` holds one test module per predefined recogniser, and each is
a ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` list of ``(text, expected_len, expected_positions, ...)`` rows: a
fragment, how many spans upstream asserts are in it, and where. That is the shape of the question
this service is asked — an identifier sitting inside a sentence — rather than a validator called on
a bare token, which is why this origin is the one that measures the rules whose subjects only ever
appear in prose.

Three things follow from the corpus rather than from a choice:

* **Upstream's fragment is what gets scanned** wherever upstream wrote a fragment. Many rows are a
  bare token with nothing around it, and those take the carrier sentence the other bare-token
  origins use, because a token with no sentence around it measures the pattern instead of the rule.
* **A row asserting zero spans is an invalid case** whose token is the whole fragment. Upstream
  names no span to point at, and the scorer's overlap test then asks upstream's own question: did
  anything of this kind fire in a fragment upstream says holds none of it.
* **A row that names no span at all** — the modules parametrised on ``text, expected_len`` alone —
  is recorded with the whole fragment as the token, which asks the same weaker question in the
  valid direction: did the right type fire anywhere in it.

Presidio recognises far more entity types than this rule set implements — driver's licences,
passports, medical and tax numbers for two dozen countries, US SSNs. Those are excluded for the
plainest reason there is, the absence of a rule, and the exclusion count is printed beside the
score so the coverage figure cannot be mistaken for a recall figure.

The script emits one JSON object per line on stdout, in the shape the Rust runner reads. It runs
inside the dev container and needs no network; the case file it writes is checked in.
