"""Turn the hoover mail slice into conformance cases for the header rules.

``vendored/reference/hoover-mail/`` is real mail: mbox archives, `.eml` files and Apple Mail
`.emlx` messages, with the message ids, dates, addresses and Received chains that were actually
written into them. Every other origin here puts a token into a sentence somebody wrote for a test.
**This one is the sentence**, and that is the whole point of it: the fragment scanned is the header
field, folding line breaks and all, which is the only place the field-scoped cue window and the
header-label test are exercised by the shape they exist for.

Where the labels come from, since no upstream assertion exists in a mailbox: RFC 5322 says what a
field means. A `Message-ID:` field holds a message id, a `Date:` field holds a date-time, an address
field holds addresses, and a `Received:` field's bracketed literal is an address literal under RFC
5321. The fields are parsed with the standard library's own mail parser and, for addresses, its
address parser — never with a pattern of ours, because a pattern of ours labelling the cases it is
then scored against measures nothing.

Three things the material decides:

* An `.emlx` file begins with the byte count of the message that follows it and ends with a
  property list, so the message is a slice rather than the file.
* A mailing-list archive obfuscates addresses as ``name at example.com``. There is no address in
  that text, so those fields yield no case rather than a mangled one.
* A message id in a `From:` line would have the same shape as an address. Cases are taken from the
  field that defines the meaning, so the address fields yield addresses and the id fields yield ids,
  and where the two rules disagree about one field the run says so.

The script emits one JSON object per line on stdout, sorted by id, in the shape the Rust runner
reads. It runs inside the dev container and needs no network; the case file it writes is checked in.
