//! Upstream conformance: do our rules agree with the projects we ported them from?
//!
//! The golden corpus measures us against cases we wrote. This measures us against cases the
//! upstream implementers wrote — every `python-stdnum` module's docstring is a labelled
//! valid/invalid corpus for its own scheme, and the same is true of the other reference projects
//! on disk. Agreement with upstream is the only evidence that a ported check digit means what its
//! author meant.
//!
//! The run is deliberately out of the fast battery's way: it is `#[ignore]`d, so `cargo test`
//! compiles and lints it but never runs it, and `./test-long.sh` runs it by name. Keeping it a
//! normal test target rather than a binary means it shares `tests/support`, gets clippy and
//! rustfmt for free, and cannot rot unnoticed.
//!
//! ## Reading an upstream test as a scan
//!
//! Upstream calls an API on a bare token; we scan free text. The translation is fixed and applied
//! uniformly, and it is recorded in the case file rather than reinvented here:
//!
//! - **The carrier.** Every token is placed in one neutral sentence that contains no digits, no
//!   currency symbol and no cue word of its own, so the only thing the scanner can find in a case
//!   is the token.
//! - **The cue.** Several rules refuse a bare token without a nearby cue word, because a check
//!   digit alone is a one-in-ten filter. Calling `stdnum.cusip.validate` *is* the statement "this
//!   is a CUSIP", so that scheme's own documented cue goes in the carrier. A cue is never supplied
//!   to a rule that does not require one.
//! - **The token is verbatim.** Separators, case and punctuation are left exactly as upstream
//!   wrote them, because how a number survives contact with real prose is the property under test.
//!
//! ## The three numbers
//!
//! Recall, precision and coverage are reported separately and never blended. Recall is over
//! upstream-valid cases in a scheme we implement; precision is over upstream-invalid ones, and
//! asks only whether we stayed silent — except where upstream's assertion was about one
//! recogniser rather than about a span, for which see `classify`; coverage is how much of the extracted material was scored
//! at all. Every excluded case carries an individually justifiable reason and is counted beside
//! the scores, because a run that excludes its way to a good number is worthless.
