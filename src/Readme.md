# `src/`

The scanner and the service around it.

| Module | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `model.rs` | The output contract: `Entity`, `Value`, `EntityType`, `Flag`, and the cross-type precedence order. |
| `data.rs` | Loading of the vendored reference data the validators consult, once at startup. |
| `rules/` | One candidate pattern and one validator per entity type. |
| `scan/` | The pipeline: prefilter, then validate and normalise inside the rules, then resolve. |
| `service.rs` | The HTTP surface. |
| `main.rs` | The service shell: load, compile, serve. |

## Why the work is split this way

Matching is the cheap half of this problem. A pattern that finds every date in a corpus is a
morning's work; a pattern that finds every date and nothing that merely looks like one does not
exist. So the scanner is two-stage, and the two stages are held to different rules:

- The **prefilter** runs over raw document text and must stay in a linear-time engine. No
  lookaround, no backreferences, no catastrophic backtracking on a document somebody else wrote.
  It is allowed — expected — to over-match.
- The **validator** sees one candidate at a time and may be as expensive as it likes. It re-imposes
  the guards that had to be stripped out of the pattern, applies the checks that decide truth
  (calendar validity, check digits, list membership, plausibility windows), and produces the
  canonical value.

Everything that leaves this crate has been through both. A span with no canonical value is not an
extraction, it is a substring, and a facet built out of substrings is the thing nobody ends up
using.

## Byte offsets

Matching is on bytes and offsets are byte offsets, absolute in the source document. A caller
scanning a large document splits it into overlapping windows — the overlap at least as long as the
longest matchable entity — passes each window's own offset as `base_offset`, and deduplicates on
`(type, start, end)`. Never split a window mid-codepoint.
