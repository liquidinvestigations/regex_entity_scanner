//! What we know about each rule, written down once.
//!
//! This is static because it is knowledge about the rule, not about any particular match: the
//! standard that defines the format, the authority that administers it, what the validator verifies
//! and what it deliberately does not. It belongs next to the rule for the same reason a doc comment
//! does — it goes stale the moment it lives anywhere else.
//!
//! Every rule gets an entry. A rule with an entry and no shaper in [`super::cards`] still produces
//! a usable card from this alone, so the catalogue is the requirement and the shaper is the polish.
//!
//! `not_checked` deserves as much care as `checks`. A reader deciding whether to trust a match
//! needs to know that a validated address has never been delivered to, and that a valid check digit
//! says a number is well-formed and nothing whatever about whether it was ever issued.
