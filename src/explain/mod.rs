//! Explainer cards: what a match means, for the person looking at it.
//!
//! A client holds an entity exactly as `/scan` returned it. When a reader clicks the highlight, the
//! client posts that entity back, unchanged, and gets a card: a title, a subtitle, and a longer
//! body, plus the facts and reference links behind them.
//!
//! Two properties shape this module.
//!
//! **The entity is the whole input.** Nothing is looked up in a session, a cache or the original
//! document — an entity is self-describing, so a card can be produced from one that was extracted
//! months ago by a client that has kept it. Only `rule_id` is required; every other field is used
//! if present and ignored if not, because an entity from an older rule set must still explain
//! itself rather than fail.
//!
//! **The knowledge is static and lives in [`catalog`].** What a rule matches, which standard
//! defines it, which authority administers it, what the validator checked and — as importantly —
//! what it did not check, are properties of the rule, written down once next to it. The per-rule
//! shapers in [`cards`] add what only this particular match can say: its country, its precision,
//! the authority register entry for its own top-level domain.
