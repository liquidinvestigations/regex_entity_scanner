//! Rule definitions: one candidate pattern plus one validator each.
//!
//! A rule owns both halves of the two-stage design. [`Rule::candidate_pattern`] is deliberately
//! loose and must be expressible in a linear-time engine — no lookaround, no backreferences —
//! because it runs over raw, attacker-influenceable document text. [`Rule::validate`] then sees
//! one candidate at a time and may be as expensive as it likes: it re-imposes the guards that were
//! stripped out of the pattern, applies the checks that decide truth, and produces the canonical
//! value.
//!
//! Adding a type is therefore a pattern, a validator and a fixture — not a new pipeline.
