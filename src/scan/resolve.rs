//! Stage four: decide between accepted spans that cover the same bytes.
//!
//! Rules scan independently, so a date candidate and a phone candidate can both cover the same
//! digits and both pass their own validator. Emitting both puts one document in two facets on the
//! strength of one number, which is exactly the kind of noise that makes a facet untrustworthy.
//!
//! The order is: structural strength first, then length, then position. Strength before length
//! because a match that had to satisfy a checksum or a calendar is the less accidental reading even
//! when it is the shorter one; length after that because within one type the longer match is the
//! more completely parsed one — a full timestamp beats the bare date inside it.
//!
//! Overlap is decided by dropping, so this stage is where one false positive costs two entities.
//! An angle-bracketed address read as a message id outranks the address reading and is longer, so
//! the address is deleted and the fragment reports one wrong entity in place of one right one. The
//! ladder is not the thing to change when that happens — on a real `Message-ID:` line the
//! message-id reading is correct and the address reading must lose, and the two are mutually
//! exclusive claims about the same bytes. What has to change is the rule that proposed a reading it
//! could not justify.
